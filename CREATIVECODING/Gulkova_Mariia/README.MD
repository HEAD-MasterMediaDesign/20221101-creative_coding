Description:

With this project, I wanted to show that even after something terrible, life does not end, the main thing is to find the path along which you will go further. 
The first function of my project is the association from the explosions.  Further, it is like the doors of the paths, depicted with different functions.  And at the end, the last frame is an image of a woman who feeds her child in the Kiev metro, hiding from the explosions.  For Ukrainians, now it is like the personification of the fact that you canâ€™t give up, and you need to continue your life
