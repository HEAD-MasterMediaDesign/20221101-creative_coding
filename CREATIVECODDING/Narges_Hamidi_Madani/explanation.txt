Title:
Body beyond Boundary
Dancing is illegal for women in Iran. However, as an Iranian girl, I was always passionate about dancing and body expression. I used to dance in my room behind closed doors to express my feelings and enjoy my time. Those days, I dreamed of dancing freely in the streets between people. After coming to Geneva, I can see Iranian girls dancing in the street as a way of expressing their objection. Therefore, I came to this idea to show what might happen if we put aside these boundaries and share our worlds with others. It is so interesting how diverse worlds can be mixed together to create new shapes, experiences, and even new humans. 
In this video, you see a girl dancing in her room. This room is built with Persian motifs extracted from Iranian miniatures. Her dancing moves the bricks of these walls around her until they finally fall and she is free. In the end, we can see that her world is being expanded. That is when others will see her, and her world will be blended with others' world. In the future, this project will show the mixture of different worlds by using different cultural motifs to depict how they can create new shapes of art. Our worlds are not as the walls around us but as the mixture of cells which can always change
