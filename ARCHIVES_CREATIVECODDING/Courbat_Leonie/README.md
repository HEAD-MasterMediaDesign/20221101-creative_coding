For the Creative Coding class, I worked on a contemplative project using grass as the main the subject.

I explored the different ways I could use it to create a calm and surreal landscape. I also composed the 
music and synched it with the colors and the swinging of the grass. To make my composition a bit more surreal, I added some « fog » made from organic and transparent shapes.
