## explanation

I started this project from a type of sphere made by points. Those points are from the longitude and lattiude coordonates mapped from this sphere. Then I thougth about an ellipse rotating around this sphere and it made the atom.

From this atom I started thinking about adding it to a bigger system. There it made me think about this amerindian legend from my country Panama. The Kuna (or Tule in Colombia) talk about humans ancestors coming from the stars. This idea has also similarities with other culture myths such as the summerian one. This made me reflect on its part of truth and after investigating I found out that here is a scientifical conscensus stating that the principal atoms composing our bodies and other living things have their origin in dead stars older than our sun.

Those informations inspired me to create a small narration with a principal character being my atom that is wandering and travelling through a DNA branch, a constellation, a globe to end up at the point of a finger.
