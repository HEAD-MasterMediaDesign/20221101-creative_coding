# Real true plain.

You can wander in this oneiric, dreamy plain. The sky and the ground are changing, creating different moods, generating sounds. 
The goal was to have really organic rendering from the particle system. I used multiple images array with subtle move to simulate a natural environment. 
My starting point was the smoke script example from processing, after making small changes by testing new images for the texture I obtained quite satisfying results and expanded theses textures in two hemispheres that join themsleves in an also changeable horizon line.
