# Multiverse of life and conspiracies

## Introduction
This project aims the creation of an environment of contemplation/meditation set in space. Through different scenes, it's possible to immerse oneself in different concepts of space:
* the more 'realistic' one, showing the scientific version and following the trajectory of earth
* a version including various conspiracies (flat earth and geocentric system)
* a more artistic depiction of life with body parts
* a totally abstract version, with plots and various shapes representing the chaos of life 

## Details
Starting from a standard representation of space, a path of research and abstraction led to a more artistic and elaborate version of various 3D forms. The idea is to have these different universes available and to be able to compare them by showing them side by side and have the concept of parallel multiverse.
